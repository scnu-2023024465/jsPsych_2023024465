Self-Referential Encoding Task (SRET) is a classic psychological experimental paradigm (learning-recognition paradigm) to study how individuals process information related to the self. 
In SRET, participants were asked to assess a series of descriptive words to determine whether the words can describe themselves. 
This task is considered to be able to mobilize the self-attention and self-cognition processes of the subjects, and it is therefore widely used to explore the psychological mechanisms of self-concept and self-perception.
